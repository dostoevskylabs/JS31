    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    const team = players;
    team[3] = "Lux";
    console.log(players, team);
    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();
    const team3 = [...players];
    const team4 = [].concat(players);
    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
        name: "elijah seymour",
        age: 26
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    //captain.number = 99;
    console.log(captain);
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number : 99 });
    console.log(cap2);
    //const cap3 = [...person]; // one level deep
    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    // clone deep?
